This project is performing RFE to predict car price with multiple linear regreesion. RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) is a feature selection method used in data modeling. It works by recursively removing features from the input data and evaluating the model performance using the remaining features. The process continues until the desired number of features is reached or until the model performance stops improving.
